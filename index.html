                    I have been in the legal field for the last 10 years as a paralegal, and have enjoyed my time in this field. I have been contempalting the move to development for a few years now, taking a few free classes here and there and trying the self taught route. I'm a Recent graduate of the University of Denver full stack development bootcamp, the focus was on the MERN stack with a few classes based in Python. The link below is from a group project where we built a strore front. 
                    I worked primarliy on the backend using API's and routing. 
                   I started the bootcamp with very limited knowledge of being a developer, while our focus was the MERN stack. I enjoyed all aspects of this stack, realy enjoying my time spent with REACT.
                   One of the biggest upsides to this industry is the continuous learning. I have always had a team player mentality,
                   helping anyone and anywhere that is needed to achieve the end goal
                   and always welcoming feedback to help with my growth. I have also added a copy of my resume below.

                    Outside of the office you can find me enjoying good food, coffee, maybe at the gym or volunteering at a local garage that services vehicles for those in need.
