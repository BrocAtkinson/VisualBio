                    I have been in the legal field for the last 10 years as a paralegal, and have enjoyed my time in this field. I have been contempalting the move to development for a few years now, taking a few free classes here and there and trying the self taught route. I'm a Recent graduate of the University of Denver full stack development bootcamp, the focus was on the MERN stack with a few classes based in Python. When I was researching what makes a person a good fit for this industry, problem solving, creative, and non stop learning where terms that I kept running into and all 3 excited me. One of the biggest upsides to this industry is the continuous learning.

                    The link below is from a group project where we built a storefront. 
                    I worked primarily on the backend using API's and routing. 
                   I started the Bootcamp with very limited knowledge of being a developer, while our focus was the MERN stack. I enjoyed all aspects of this stack, really enjoying my time spent with REACT.
                   One of the biggest upsides to this industry is the continuous learning. I have always had a team player mentality,
                   helping anyone and anywhere that is needed to achieve the end goal and always welcoming feedback to help with my growth.

                    Outside of the office you can find me enjoying good food, coffee, maybe at the gym or volunteering at a local garage that services vehicles for those in need.  I have always had a team player mentality, helping anyone and anywhere that is needed to achieve the end goal
                    and always welcome feedback to help with my growth.
